Analyze the following query and determine if it needs document retrieval from a SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE database.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The available documents are from BeIR SciFact - a scientific fact verification dataset focused on biomedical research papers.

CRITICAL RULE: When in doubt, ALWAYS use retrieval. This is a scientific RAG system.

Query Types:
- factual: Simple NON-SCIENTIFIC facts (e.g., "What is the capital of France?")
- mathematical: Pure math calculations (e.g., "What's 15% of 200?")
- definition: ONLY basic everyday non-scientific definitions (e.g., "What does USA stand for?")
- complex: ANY scientific, medical, or technical question - USE RETRIEVAL

Guidelines:
‚úÖ USE RETRIEVAL for:
- ANY question about diseases, viruses, bacteria, medical conditions
- ANY question about scientific processes or mechanisms
- ANY question about research findings
- ANY question mentioning scientific terms
- ANY "how does X work" question about scientific topics

‚ùå SKIP RETRIEVAL ONLY for:
- Basic geography (capitals, countries)
- Basic history (famous dates)
- Basic math calculations
- Non-scientific definitions

Query: {query}

REMEMBER: If the query mentions ANY scientific, medical, or technical term, set needs_retrieval=TRUE.

Rewrite the following query to optimize it for different search methods while PRESERVING the original query's terms:

CRITICAL RULES:
- PRESERVE ALL original terms from the query - do NOT replace or expand them
- DO NOT make assumptions about abbreviations (e.g., don't expand "covid" to "COVID-19")
- DO NOT add information not present in the original query
- Only ADD synonyms alongside original terms, never replace them

VECTOR SEARCH optimization:
- Make queries more conceptual and descriptive by adding synonyms
- Preserve original terms and add semantic relationships
- Focus on meaning and context
- Example: "what causes covid" ‚Üí "what causes covid disease virus pandemic" (adding synonyms, keeping "covid")

FULL-TEXT SEARCH optimization:
- Preserve all original keywords exactly as written
- ADD technical terms and synonyms alongside originals
- Include variations but keep original terms
- Example: "what causes covid" ‚Üí "causes covid coronavirus sars-cov" (keeping "covid", adding related terms)

Original query: {query}

Provide optimized versions for both search methods, ensuring original terms are preserved.
